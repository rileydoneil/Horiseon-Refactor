## Purpose

This was a refractor challenge where I was cleaning up code and adding alt text to various media being presented in a web format.

## Lessons

This lesson taught me how to clean up the language for calling elements and using naming semantics that match purpose and tradition. 
Additionally, I learned how alt text can be used to provide more accessible features to our html files and websites.
